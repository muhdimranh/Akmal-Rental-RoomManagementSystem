# Akmal Rental Room Management System

1. Introduction
Akmal Rentals is a room rental service company based in Johor Bahru, serving individuals commuting between Johor and Singapore. They currently operate in Larkin and Taman Nusantara, Gelang Patah, with a total of 115 rooms across 9 floors. However, their existing manual system, involving spreadsheet data entry, phone reminders, and Google Drive storage, is complex and time-consuming. To enhance their services, they require a system that streamlines operations for administrators and investors. The proposed system will enable efficient renter tracking, payment reminders, inventory management, level information, cleaner attendance tracking, sales and profit calculations, and profit sharing with investors.
